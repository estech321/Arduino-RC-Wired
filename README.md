# Arduino Wired RC Car
The code in this repository allows you to build a simple remote-control car using an Arduino Mega and a motor driver shield such as the old [Adafruit Motor Sheild](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield) or the [OSEPPP Motor & Servo Shield](https://www.osepp.com/electronic-modules/shields/49-motor-servo-shield). It uses the [Adafruit Motor Shield Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library) to drive 4 DC motors based on inputs from a controller that is wired into the Arduino, eleminating the need for complex IR or RF modules and code. This does come with the downside of having a cord connected between the controller and the car, but if the cord is long enough, it shouldn't be too much of a problem.

# Hardware
As for the hardware, you will need a [V1 Adafruit Motor Sheild](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield), an [OSEPPP Motor & Servo Shield](https://www.osepp.com/electronic-modules/shields/49-motor-servo-shield) or some other motor driver compatible with the [Adafruit Motor Shield Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library). You'll also need four DC motors and wheels to go on them, an Arduino Mega, and a way to provide 12V to the car. I find that simply connecting lots of AA battery holders together in series works well. To enclose it all, you can go as fancy or as simple as you want. I used a long rectangular cardboard box, but you can use anything from a metal tin to a 3D-printed housing to a wooden enclosure. Just keep in mind the weight of the car and the power of the motors and the power source.

# Software
I have written all the code in Arduino C, as is typical with Arduino projects. I used VS Code and PlatformIO to write and debug my code, but I've included Arduiino IDE and raw C++ versions as well. Just use whichever platform you're used to working with - the code is pretty much the same, except for the importing of the `Arduino.h` library in the PIO version.
Speaking of libraries, the only one required to use the motor shield is the [Adafruit Motor Shield Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library). You can install it by downloading the ZIP file from GitHub and installing it, or by searching for it in the Arduino IDE library manager. If you do this, mare sure you install the one called `Adafruit Motor Shield Library`, NOT the one for the V2 sheild.

# License
A great thing about this project is that, so long as you have the same inputs and motor driver, you can build pretty much any sort of car you want. The simplicity of this code opens up tons of room for improvement, redesign, customization, and more. Feel free to fork the code and change it as you like.
